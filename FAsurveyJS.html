    <h2> FA survey</h2>
    <p>Think back to a time when your eating behavior was at its worst, and answer the questions with that time period in mind.</p>
    <p>This survey asks about your eating habits in the past year. People sometimes have difficulty controlling how much they eat of certain foods such as:
       <ul>
           <li>Sweets like ice cream, chocolate, doughnuts, cookies, cake, candy</li>
           <li>Starches like white bread, rolls, pasta, and rice</li>
           <li>Salty snacks like chips, pretzels, and crackers</li>
           <li>Fatty foods like steak, bacon, hamburgers, cheeseburgers, pizza, and French fries</li>
           <li>Sugary drinks like soda pop, lemonade, sports drinks, and energy drinks</li>
       </ul> 
        When the following questions ask about “CERTAIN FOODS” please think of ANY foods or beverages similar to those listed in the food or beverage groups above or
        ANY OTHER foods you have had difficulty with in the past year</p>
